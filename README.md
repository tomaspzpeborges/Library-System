# SimpleLibrary

This project represents coursework 1 for the module "Programming Project" at the University of Leeds. 
It consists on the logic of a simple library: there's a librarian with special accesses and there are regular users, who can create their accounts with passwords,
as well as borrow and return books.

This project was made on March 2020.
